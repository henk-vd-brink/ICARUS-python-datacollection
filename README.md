## About the Project

The goal of this project was to get a better understanding of Domain Driven Design (DDD). After reading the book 'Architecture Patterns with Python', by Harry J.W. Percival and Bob Gregory, I wanted to get a better understanding of the philosophy of DDD, event driven architecture and test driven development.
